# 1. Reminder of mistake
- Question: "Find all countries with 'United' in their name"
- Incorrect SQL: ```sql
SELECT country_id, country_name, region 
FROM countries 
WHERE country_name LIKE '%United%';
```
- Corrected SQL: ```sql
SELECT country_name 
FROM countries 
WHERE country_name LIKE '%United%';
```
- Negative and strict step-by-step ask-to-myself questions to prevent same mistake again:
  1. Am I selecting only the columns that I need from the table?
  2. Am I using the correct table name and column name in the query?
  3. Am I using the correct SQL syntax, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.?

# 2. Reminder of mistake
- Question: "List all GFS indicator names that contain 'Revenue'"
- Incorrect SQL: ```sql
SELECT T1.indicator_name 
FROM indicators AS T1 
INNER JOIN gem_observations AS T2 ON T1.indicator_id = T2.indicator_id 
WHERE T1.indicator_name LIKE '%Revenue%' AND T2.seasonal_adjustment = 0;

SELECT DISTINCT indicator_name 
FROM indicators 
WHERE source = 'GFS' AND indicator_name LIKE '%Revenue%';
